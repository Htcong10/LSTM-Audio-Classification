Author:  Ho Trung Cong 20194237

## ***Description***:

### This program:
* Clean audio
* Training model.
* Test model.


### Language: Python

## ***Modules***:

* models: a module that contains LSTM models for training model 
* clean: a functional-based module that contains functions for data preprocessing and save data for training model
* train:  a functional-based module that contains functions for training and save LSTM model
* predict :  a functional-based module that contains functions for testing model
## *** File***
* audio_train : folder include files to training model
* Testpredict : folder include files to testing model
* test.csv : a file include label of files testing to model evaluation
* Pre.csv  : a file include label predict of files testing 
## ***To run this program***

* install library in requirenment.txt
* Run clean.py to data processing.
* then Run train.py to training and save model
* final, run prediction to test model
